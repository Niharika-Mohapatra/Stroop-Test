# Stroop Task Reaction Time Analysis
This project analyzes data from a Stroop test, a classic cognitive psychology experiment designed to assess selective attention, cognitive control, and processing interference.

## Overview
Participants were shown words naming colors, either:

Congruent: word and ink color match (e.g., “Red” in red ink)

Incongruent: word and ink color mismatch (e.g., “Blue” in green ink)

They were asked to identify the color of the ink, not read the word. The reaction times for each trial were recorded and analyzed to measure interference effects.
