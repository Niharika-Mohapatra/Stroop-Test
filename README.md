# Stroop Task Reaction Time Analysis
This project analyzes data from a Stroop test, a classic cognitive psychology experiment designed to assess selective attention, cognitive control, and processing interference.

## What is the Stroop effect?
The Stroop effect is a psychological phenomenon that demonstrates the interference between automatic and controlled processes in the brain.

In its most common example, it is observed that participants in a **Stroop test** take longer to name the colour of ink in which a word is printed, when the colour of the ink and the word itself are incongruent.

## Overview
Participants were shown words naming colours, either:

Congruent: word and ink colour match (e.g., “Red” in red ink)

Incongruent: word and ink colour mismatch (e.g., “Blue” in green ink)

They were asked to identify the colour of the ink, not read the word. The reaction times for each trial were recorded and analyzed to measure interference effects.
